Alright, let’s break down what’s happening here —

⸻

🛠️ What Your Logs Show
	•	Your server starts normally:

Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:3001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)


	•	Then, someone (likely a browser) makes a GET request to /:

172.31.128.60:37094 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

That’s expected — this means they hit your homepage, your / endpoint which just returns {"message": "AI Outreach System Online"}.

	•	Then, the browser automatically tries to fetch /favicon.ico:

172.31.128.60:37094 - "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found

That 404 Not Found is normal.
Browsers always try to load a tiny icon (favicon) in the browser tab.
You didn’t define a /favicon.ico endpoint or static file, so it returns 404.

	•	But the real issue:
It looks like your server restarts over and over automatically:

Started server process [18759]
Waiting for application startup.
Application startup complete.
Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:3001



This should not be happening repeatedly unless you are running in --reload mode.

🚨 What’s Likely Causing the Restart Loop

👉 You probably launched your server with reload=True in your uvicorn.run():

uvicorn.run(
    "main:app",
    host="0.0.0.0",
    port=3001,
    reload=True,  # <-- This causes server to restart whenever files change
    log_level="info",
    proxy_headers=True,
    forwarded_allow_ips="*"
)

	•	reload=True is great for development because if you edit your code, the server automatically reloads.
	•	BUT in production or cloud, it can cause constant restarts if:
	•	Filesystem watches are unstable.
	•	Environment touches files (e.g., Docker, AWS EC2 volumes).
	•	Server thinks something “changed” even though it didn’t.

🧹 How to Fix It

If you’re done coding, and you’re running on a real server, you should turn off reload.

Change your uvicorn.run() to:

uvicorn.run(
    "main:app",
    host="0.0.0.0",
    port=3001,
    reload=False,  # <---- TURN THIS OFF
    log_level="info",
    proxy_headers=True,
    forwarded_allow_ips="*"
)

Or just remove the reload=True entirely because reload=False is default.

✅ This should stop the infinite restart problem.

🔥 Bonus Tip — How to Serve a Favicon

Since the browser keeps trying to get /favicon.ico, you can just add a tiny static route like this to make the 404s stop:

from fastapi.responses import FileResponse

@app.get("/favicon.ico")
async def favicon():
    return FileResponse("path/to/your/favicon.ico")

Or you can just ignore it — it’s harmless.
(But if you want a cleaner console without 404 spam, it’s worth adding.)

✨ Summary of Your Situation

Issue	Fix
Server keeps restarting	Remove reload=True from uvicorn.run()
Browser 404 on /favicon.ico	(Optional) Serve a favicon with a FastAPI route
Uvicorn otherwise looks healthy	✅

If you want, I can also show you how to run this even more properly behind Gunicorn + Uvicorn workers when you get ready for real production. 🚀 (Would make it even faster and safer on a real server.)
