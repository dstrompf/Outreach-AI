Amazing progress.
Now you’re deep into real testing — and what you’re seeing is expected behavior at this stage.

Let’s break down your logs carefully and explain what’s happening:

⸻

🧠 What the logs show

Log	What It Means
Started server process [4024]	Uvicorn server started successfully. ✅
GET /health and GET / returning 200 OK	/ and /health endpoints are working perfectly. ✅
Found 6296 qualified leads	Your Google Sheets pull is working fine. ✅
POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "429 Too Many Requests"	OpenAI is rate limiting your email generation. 🚨
Email generation failed for http://www.umbrellalosangeles.com/	Because of OpenAI rate limiting, email generation failed.
No emails found for	Scraper did not find any emails on the website.



⸻

🚨 Main Problems Now (New)
	1.	429 Too Many Requests
	•	You are hitting OpenAI’s rate limit.
	•	OpenAI is saying: “You are sending too many API requests too fast.”
	2.	No Emails Found
	•	Your scraper is visiting websites but finding no emails on them.

⸻

📋 Quick Solutions to Each Problem

Problem	Solution
429 Too Many Requests	Slow down your requests. Add a sleep(1-2 seconds) between each OpenAI call.
No Emails Found	Improve the scraper to look deeper (e.g., contact pages) or expand internal links.

🛠️ How to fix OpenAI 429 errors (Step-by-Step)

Inside your run_campaign() logic:

Add a small sleep after every OpenAI call, like this:

import time

@app.get("/run-campaign")
def run_campaign():
    ...
    for lead in qualified_leads[:5]:
        ...
        generate_resp = generate_email(
            GenerateEmailRequest(
                business_name=lead.get('business_name', website),
                summary=summary
            )
        )

        # ADD A SLEEP
        time.sleep(2)  # Sleep 2 seconds between OpenAI requests

        if 'error' in generate_resp:
            logger.error(f"Email generation failed for {website}")
            continue
        ...

✅ This will dramatically lower the risk of 429 errors.

(You could even make it smarter by retrying with exponential backoff — if you want later.)

⸻

🛠️ How to fix “No emails found” (optional deeper scraping)

If you want to find more emails, you can:
	•	Scrape more pages (e.g., /contact, /about, /team).
	•	Scrape footer and header of pages (emails often hide there).
	•	Scrape contact forms and detect email fields.

This would be a Phase 2 improvement after you stabilize your OpenAI usage.

🎯 Summary Right Now

Status	Result
Server setup	✅ Working
Health checks	✅ Working
Run campaign	⚠️ Working but hitting OpenAI rate limit
Email scraping	⚠️ Working but no emails found



⸻

🧠 Big Picture:

✅ You fixed all server and port issues!
✅ Your app is running properly now.
✅ Your /run-campaign endpoint works but needs slight adjustments to avoid 429 errors.

⸻

🔥 Next Steps

Step	Action
1	Add time.sleep(2) after each OpenAI call
2	(Optional) Improve scraper to find more emails
3	(Optional) Add better retry logic for OpenAI failures

💬 Would you like me to show you also how to add a “smart retry” system for OpenAI 429 errors?

(It would automatically wait and retry if OpenAI says “too many requests” instead of failing completely.)
Super useful if you’re running bigger campaigns 🚀

👉 Ready to add that if you want! 🎯
Let me know!
You’re very close to a fully working system 🔥
