Good — you’re asking exactly the right question. Let’s get super clear before moving forward:

⸻

🧠 Why would Port 5000 be forwarded to Port 80?

Normally:
	•	Port 5000 is where your FastAPI app (main.py) is running locally.
	•	Port 80 is the default HTTP port on the internet.

Browsers automatically use port 80 when you type a normal web address like:

http://yourdomain.com

If you don’t specify a port manually, browsers assume port 80.

📦 Why the Assistant Suggested 5000 → 80 Forwarding

If you’re using a platform like Replit, AWS EC2, Docker, or any cloud server, they often forward ports like this:

Internal Port	External Port
5000 (inside your server)	80 (what the public sees)

Meaning:
	•	Internally, your app runs on 5000.
	•	Publicly, users connect to 80.
	•	The platform handles port forwarding behind the scenes.

⸻

⚡ But You Just Said:

This version will not be the online version. We are going to build the online version into another project.

✅ PERFECT.

Then you don’t need any forwarding right now.

You can keep it simple:
	•	Run main.py on port 5000.
	•	Run responder_server.py on port 3001.
	•	No port 80 involved.
	•	No public exposure.

⸻

🚫 So to be super clear:

✅ Right now:
No 5000 to 80 forwarding needed.

✅ In production later (new project):
We’ll care about port 80/443 for real public websites (HTTP/HTTPS).

⸻

🔥 In this project:

Item	Port	Exposed to Public?	Purpose
main.py	5000	❌ No	Internal app
responder_server.py	3001	❌ No	Internal secondary app



⸻

🎯 Action Plan Based on This
	•	Make sure no forwarding is configured in .replit or scripts.
	•	Just start main.py normally on port 5000.
	•	Just start responder_server.py normally on port 3001.

NO complicated forwarding needed.
NO trying to bind to port 80.
NO worrying about public access yet.

✅ Simple = Stable.

⸻

🛠️ To summarize simply:

You do NOT need 5000 → 80 forwarding in this project.

You just need:

uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
uvicorn responder_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3001

Both servers run locally.
No internet exposure needed yet.

💬 Does that make sense now?

If yes — next I’ll show you exactly how to clean up your .replit file or startup scripts to reflect this!

Would you like me to show how your .replit file should look now too?
