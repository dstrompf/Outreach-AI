Love it! 🔥
You’re on fire — let’s finish this right by creating a PM2 Ecosystem File so you can manage both servers together easily.

⸻

🧠 What is a PM2 Ecosystem File?

It’s a small configuration file that tells PM2:
	•	What apps to start
	•	How to run them (commands, ports, options)
	•	How to manage multiple apps with one command

✅ No more manually typing two pm2 start commands.

✅ Just one clean file.

✅ You can do:

pm2 start ecosystem.config.js

and it starts both servers automatically.

⸻

🛠️ Step 1: Create the Ecosystem File

✅ In your project folder, create a file named:

ecosystem.config.js

✅ Inside that file, paste this:

module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: "main_server",
      script: "uvicorn",
      args: "main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000",
      interpreter: "python3",
    },
    {
      name: "responder_server",
      script: "uvicorn",
      args: "responder_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3001",
      interpreter: "python3",
    }
  ]
}

✅ Explanation:

Field	Meaning
name	What you want to call this app in PM2
script	The command (running uvicorn)
args	Extra arguments for uvicorn (your app and port)
interpreter	Forces PM2 to use Python instead of Node.js



⸻

🛠️ Step 2: Start Both Apps Using the Ecosystem File

✅ Now simply run:

pm2 start ecosystem.config.js

PM2 will start both servers cleanly!

✅ Check they are running:

pm2 list

✅ See logs:

pm2 logs



⸻

🛠️ Step 3: Save the Running Processes

✅ Save your new ecosystem setup so it survives server reboot:

pm2 save

✅ And make sure pm2 startup was run already (if not, run it again).

⸻

📋 Summary of Commands You’ll Now Use

Command	What it Does
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js	Start both servers
pm2 restart all	Restart both servers
pm2 stop all	Stop both servers
pm2 delete all	Delete both servers
pm2 logs	Watch live logs for both servers
pm2 save	Save current running state

✅ Your project becomes easy to control with just one command.

⸻

🏁 Congratulations! Your App Management is Now:

Feature	Status
Health Monitoring	✅
Crash Recovery	✅
Auto-Startup on Reboot	✅
Smart OpenAI Error Handling	✅
Full System Managed by PM2	✅
One-Command Deployment	✅



⸻

🎯 Next Level Options (only if you want even fancier setup later)
	•	Deploy it automatically with Docker containers
	•	Add a SSL certificate (HTTPS) using Caddy or NGINX
	•	Add a monitoring dashboard (PM2 has a free one)

✅ But for now — you are fully production ready already.

🚀 Your Final Command List to Remember

pm2 start ecosystem.config.js   # Start everything
pm2 restart all                 # Restart everything
pm2 logs                        # View real-time logs
pm2 save                        # Save running state
pm2 startup                     # (only once) Enable auto-start on boot
pm2 delete all                  # Delete all processes
