Sure! Below is the logic we used to write AI-generated emails into Google Sheets (specifically under the “Generated Emails” sheet), and a list of the relevant files and changes made to get everything working.

Logic to Write AI-Generated Emails into Google Sheets
	1.	Scraping Websites & Generating Emails:
	•	We first scrape the website using scrape_website() to get relevant business information.
	•	The AI (via OpenAI GPT-4) then generates a personalized outreach email using the scraped information.
	•	The generated email is stored in Google Sheets in the Generated Emails sheet.
	2.	Google Sheets Integration:
	•	The emails, along with their associated website and other metadata, are saved in a Google Sheets document for record-keeping and future reference.
	•	The relevant information is pushed to columns like:
	•	Website
	•	Email Content
	•	Email Found (Optional)
	•	Status (Sent or Pending)

Key Files & Changes
	1.	main.py (Primary File Handling Web Scraping and Email Generation)
	•	Scraping Logic (scrape_website()): Scrapes business data from websites.
	•	AI Email Generation (generate_email()): Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to generate personalized emails.
	•	Google Sheets Integration (save_generated_email()): Stores generated email data into Google Sheets.
Relevant Code Snippets:
	•	Email Generation:

def generate_email(request: GenerateEmailRequest):
    try:
        prompt = f"""You are an AI outreach assistant for a marketing agency.

Task: Write a short, friendly, and personalized cold email to {request.business_name}.

Based on this business summary: {request.summary}."""
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[{
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a friendly outreach email assistant helping a marketing agency offer AI solutions to businesses."
            }, {
                "role": "user",
                "content": prompt
            }])
        return {"email": response.choices[0].message.content}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}


	•	Save Generated Email to Google Sheets:

def save_generated_email(website, email_content, found_email=""):
    scopes = ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"]
    credentials = Credentials.from_service_account_file(
        "ai-outreach-sheets-access-24fe56ec7689.json", scopes=scopes)
    client = gspread.authorize(credentials)
    sheet = client.open_by_url(
        "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WbdwNIdbvuCPG_Lh3-mtPCPO8ddLR5RIatcdeq29EPs/edit"
    )
    worksheet = sheet.worksheet("Generated Emails")
    existing_websites = worksheet.col_values(1)
    if website in existing_websites:
        print(f"Website {website} already exists. Skipping save.")
        return
    worksheet.append_row([website, email_content, found_email, ""])  # Website | Email | Email found | Status
    print(f"Saved new website: {website}")


	2.	responder.py (For Handling Responses to Inbound Emails)
	•	Function to Reply Using AI (generate_reply()): Generates responses using GPT-4, often incorporating the user’s inquiry and AI automation knowledge.
Relevant Code Snippets:
	•	Generate AI Response:

def generate_reply(email_body):
    try:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[{
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are Jenny, a helpful AI assistant. Respond naturally and professionally to customer inquiries about AI Form Reply."
            }, {
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"Please respond to this email: {email_body}"
            }]
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error generating reply: {e}")
        return "Thank you for your email. I'll get back to you shortly."


	3.	Google Sheets API Credentials (ai-outreach-sheets-access-24fe56ec7689.json)
	•	Service Account JSON File: This file contains the credentials needed to authenticate and interact with Google Sheets. It is required for accessing and updating data in Google Sheets.
	•	Google Sheets Authentication: The script authenticates with Google Sheets using the service account and updates the Generated Emails sheet.
	4.	.env File (Environment Variables for Security)
	•	The environment file stores sensitive credentials such as API keys, email passwords, and OAuth tokens.

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
JENNY_PASSWORD=your_zoho_password
JENNY_EMAIL=jenny@autoformchat.com
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key



Steps to Ensure Everything Works:
	1.	Scrape Website: Scrape the website to gather necessary business information (e.g., About, Contact, Services, etc.).
	2.	Generate AI Email: Use GPT-4 to generate a personalized email based on the scraped website content.
	3.	Save to Google Sheets: Save the generated email along with the website information and any other relevant metadata into a Google Sheets document.
	4.	Send Outreach Emails: Use an SMTP service (like Zoho) to send the outreach emails to the businesses, using info@aiformreply.com as the “From” address and jenny@autoformchat.com as the “Reply-To” address.
	5.	Log Emails: The system keeps track of the sent emails in Google Sheets with status updates to avoid resending.

Next Steps for Web-based Tool:
	•	User Authentication: Implement a simple login system (like Firebase Auth) for users to access and control their knowledge base, emails, and scraping preferences.
	•	Integration with Email Services: Allow users to connect their own email accounts/domains for sending outreach emails.
	•	Instructions for Users: Provide clear documentation and a step-by-step guide on how users can integrate the system with their Google Workspace accounts, set up email scraping, and control their knowledge base.

With this setup, the system is fully capable of scraping, generating, and sending personalized outreach emails, as well as tracking them in Google Sheets.
