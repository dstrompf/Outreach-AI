Sure! Here’s the full updated logic with Google Sheets integration, scraping, email generation with OpenAI, and sending the email via Zoho SMTP. The assistant will also correctly send emails from @aiformreply.com and set jenny@autoformchat.com as the reply-to address.

Key Features:
	1.	Scraping: The scrape_and_generate_emails() function scrapes websites and generates emails using OpenAI. It finds emails from the website (or uses a placeholder email for now) and stores them in the Google Sheets.
	2.	Email Generation: The AI generates a personalized response using OpenAI, based on the scraped content, and sends it to the business owner using Zoho’s SMTP server.
	3.	Google Sheets Integration: The save_generated_email() function stores the website, generated email content, and any found email in the Google Sheet.
	4.	Automatic Replying: The process_emails() function listens for incoming emails in the jenny@autoformchat.com inbox, generates a reply using the AI model, and sends it to the sender.

To Test:
	1.	Run the script: After starting the script, it will automatically fetch unread emails, generate responses, and send them via SMTP.
	2.	Set up Google Sheets: Ensure that your Google Sheets are set up with the correct credentials and the spreadsheet has the appropriate columns (e.g., website, generated email, found email).
	3.	Check Emails: Ensure that the email from jenny@autoformchat.com contains the generated AI reply, and that the correct sender’s reply-to address is set.

This updated logic should allow your system to scrape websites, generate personalized emails, store them in Google Sheets, and send them via Zoho SMTP. Let me know if you’d like further tweaks!
