Your code is very solid overall ‚Äî organized, clean imports, good logging, correct FastAPI structure, good error handling ‚Äî BUT there are a few issues, improvements, and cautions you should be aware of.

‚∏ª

1. openai Client Import / Usage

‚úÖ You are importing OpenAI properly from openai.

BUT, the newer openai Python SDK (>= 1.0.0) changed a bit:

from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

This is correct for the new openai library.

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you‚Äôre using the new library version (pip install openai --upgrade), otherwise old tutorials will confuse you.

‚∏ª

2. resend Email API

‚úÖ You‚Äôre importing resend, but you never actually send an email in the code.
	‚Ä¢	You save generated emails to a Google Sheet but never use resend to actually send the emails yet.
	‚Ä¢	That‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôre planning to add it later.
	‚Ä¢	If not, importing resend is unnecessary right now.

‚Üí Tiny optimization: remove it if unused.

‚∏ª

3. save_generated_email() Google Sheets access

‚ö†Ô∏è You‚Äôre loading credentials from a hardcoded filename:

"ai-outreach-sheets-access-24fe56ec7689.json"

If this file is missing (or if you run the app in a production server like Vercel, Render, DigitalOcean, etc.), the app will crash.

‚úÖ Recommendation:
	‚Ä¢	Either check if file exists first
	‚Ä¢	Or allow an environment variable for the path.

Example:

SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = os.getenv("GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE", "ai-outreach-sheets-access-24fe56ec7689.json")



‚∏ª

4. Scraper Timeouts & Retry Strategy

Your scrape_website function:

requests.get(link, headers=headers, timeout=10)

‚úÖ Good: you added timeout.

‚ö†Ô∏è Potential problem:
	‚Ä¢	If a page is slow to load or blocks you, you don‚Äôt retry.

‚Üí Better: add requests retries with a Session and Retry strategy.

Example:

from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from requests.packages.urllib3.util.retry import Retry

session = requests.Session()
retry = Retry(total=3, backoff_factor=1, status_forcelist=[429, 500, 502, 503, 504])
adapter = HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retry)
session.mount('http://', adapter)
session.mount('https://', adapter)

response = session.get(request.url, headers=headers, timeout=10)

Just a safety net for scraping reliability.

‚∏ª

5. /generate_email endpoint

Right now, your /generate_email endpoint is chatting with GPT-4 live without rate limiting.

‚ö†Ô∏è If someone hits your endpoint 1000x quickly (even accidentally), it could:
	‚Ä¢	Overwhelm your OpenAI usage quota
	‚Ä¢	Rack up costs fast

‚úÖ Recommendation:
	‚Ä¢	Add simple rate limiting middleware or
	‚Ä¢	Require an API key/token for users if this ever goes public.

‚∏ª

6. Misc Small Things

Section	Issue	Suggestion
find_internal_links	No timeout handling for subpages	Consider catching and logging slow subpage errors separately
/run-campaign	for lead in qualified_leads[:5]	Maybe parametrize ‚Äúbatch size‚Äù later
if __name__ == "__main__"	Good for local running	‚úÖ works fine, but remember Vercel, Render, etc. won‚Äôt use this, they need an asgi.py or main:app entrypoint



‚∏ª

Summary

Type	Rating
Architecture	‚úÖ Very Good
Error Handling	‚úÖ Good
Security/Scaling	‚ö†Ô∏è Could Improve
Scraping Robustness	‚ö†Ô∏è Could Improve
Deployment Readiness	‚úÖ Local Only, needs tweaks for cloud



‚∏ª

Final Score: 8.5 / 10

(Just need minor enhancements for production-readiness!)

‚∏ª

Would you like me to also show you a ‚Äúproduction ready‚Äù version of your scrape_website() and save_generated_email() functions?
I can write those with retries + environment-based credential loading if you want üöÄ
Would be super useful if you plan to deploy this anywhere.
Want me to? üéØ
